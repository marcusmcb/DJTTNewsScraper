## Using The App:

If it's the first time that you've used this app, you should see nothing when the home page loads.  If you've previously used the app, the home page will display any articles from the DJTT news page that have been previously saved or scraped.

Either way, to get started simply click the scrape button on the upper right hand side.  After doing so the page should populate with the latest entries from the DJTT news site including the title, summary and link to the article.  

You also have the option to save the article for later use if you so choose.  Clicking the "save article" link will remove the article from the list and move it over into your Saved Articles, which you can access at any time by clicking the "Saved Articles" button on the upper right-hand side.

Upon clicking the "Saved Articles" button, you will see a list of any/all of your previously saved articles.  You delete any saved article by clicking its corresponding link.  Doing so will remove the article from your saved list.  

To grab the latest news articles or to repopulate the home page again, simply click the "home" button from the Saved Articles page and you're good to go.
